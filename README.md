Hello, dear readers
This is my first experience on making a site using HTML
I gotta say, it went pretty well. Only trouble I encountered was attaching photoes to the site.
Safe to say, I'll need to make some practice on that front.
But other than that, I'm really pleased on how it went, and eventhough I'm only at the start and evemthough I made some mistakes, I'm overwhealmed by my experience in programming so far.
Thank you for reading, appreciate it mate.
